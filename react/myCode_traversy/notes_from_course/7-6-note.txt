#Ok so, your router from react-router-dom module are not working as intended 
so your gonna have trouble displaying content depending on changes in the url 

#most of your code is correct you have decent understandig of the props and state in a 
componenet don't worry too much about it you understand all the point 

# the only problem with the contact manager is that something doesn't seems to work 
as intended 

#the states are not rendering when you change them i don't know what's going on there
but other then that it's working good

# i would advise you to learn more about rendering states in the dom in react 
the course you took was a year old so it might be that there are some updates in the 
react library that is casuing your to not run as intended
